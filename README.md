# Geofencing App with React Native and Expo

This project is a **Geofencing App** built using **React Native** and **Expo**. The app allows users to set geofenced locations and receive notifications when they exit these locations. The app works in the background using Expoâ€™s `Location` and `TaskManager` APIs and allows users to manage up to five geofences at a time. 

## Features

- **Real-time Geofencing**: Set geofenced areas and receive push notifications when exiting.
- **Background Location Tracking**: Continuously tracks user location in the background to detect geofence exits.
- **Location Editing and Removal**: Easily add, edit, or remove geofences.
- **Push Notifications**: Notifications triggered when exiting geofences.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and simple interface to manage geofenced locations.
